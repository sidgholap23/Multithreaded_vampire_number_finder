--  Execute the  source code in linux based system by  : 
                                    (gcc Assgn2Src-AI22BTECH11007.c -o AI11007 -lm -pthread) 
    command in the terminal.

--  Do not directly run it in vscode, it will throw up an error(because -lm -pthread is required 
    to compile), just compile it in the terminal by above command and then execute it by (./AI11007) 
    command.

--  Provide the inputs in Infile.txt as: N<space>M 

--  After executing the source file, the outputs will be displayed in the OutFile.txt file.

--  NOTE: I have defined max_count and max_threads in the source file which represents maximum 
            number of numbers assigned to each thread and maximum number of threads respectively. 
            So, you can alter them for higher values.
